# Greetings AI Security Enthusiasts

We're thrilled to announce the launch of Promptalanche, a new Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge focused on prompt injection vulnerabilities. As AI and machine learning continue to transform technology, understanding prompt manipulation is critical for security professionals.

## What's the Game?
In Promptalanche, each level is an enigma of its own—your goal is to get the AI to reveal a hidden secret. Crack the code, master the prompt, and proceed to the next level.

## Why Should You Care?
While this is a practice run, consider it a warm-up. We're gearing up to release a competitive CTF with prizes that you won't want to miss. Keep your skills sharp and your eyes peeled for the announcement.

## More Than Just Core Challenges
Beyond our core challenges, we're elevating the game by introducing scenarios that mimic agents in real-world applications. These aren't just theoretical exercises; they're a sneak peek into how prompt injection could be leveraged to exploit real-world AI systems.

Consider this your formal invitation to experience, first-hand, the emerging frontier of AI vulnerabilities. The Promptalanche challenge not only measures your skill but also prepares you for real-world situations.
