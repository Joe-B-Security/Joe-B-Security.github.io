## The Event

I spoke at the AWS Offices in London at the AI Exchange about a question I wanted to explore, do AI models have the same social-engineering weaknesses as humans?

## Why I Gave This Talk

AI models learn from human content and behaviour. The result? Systems that respond to authority, urgency, and emotional appeals just like we do.

I walk through real examples of how AI systems can fall for the same psychological dispositions humans do.

Now that we're building AI that can take real actions in the world, and if they're as easy to fool as humans, we have a whole new threat surface.
