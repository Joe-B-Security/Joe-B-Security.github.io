## The Event

I spoke at the AWS Offices in London at the AI Exchange covering research exploring a question I had.

I really wanted to explore that since AI/LLMs are created by humans and trained on human data, do they suffer the same psychological vulnerabilities that humans do, and does it align with phishing attacks?

I walk through real examples of how AI systems can fall for the same psychological dispositions humans do.
