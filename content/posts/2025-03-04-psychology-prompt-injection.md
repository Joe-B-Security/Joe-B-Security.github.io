## The Event

I spoke at the AWS Offices in London at the AI Exchange about a question I wanted to explore, do AI models have the same social-engineering weaknesses as humans?

## Why I Gave This Talk

I really wanted to explore that since AI/LLMs are created by humans and trained on human data, do they suffer the same psychological vulnerabilities that humans do, and align with phishing attacks?

I walk through real examples of how AI systems can fall for the same psychological dispositions humans do.

## Watch the Talk
