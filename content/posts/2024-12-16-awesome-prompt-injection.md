## What's Inside

I built [Awesome Prompt Injection](https://github.com/Joe-B-Security/awesome-prompt-injection) - a curated collection of resources for prompt injection to assist learning and exploring about this novel attack vector.

The repo is organized around what people actually need:

- **Research & Articles**: The foundational knowledge, from academic papers to real-world case studies
- **Tools**: Everything from Token Turbulenz (fuzzing framework) to Garak (automated weakness detection) to InjectLab (attack technique matrix)
- **CTF Challenges**: Hands-on practice scenarios that simulate real prompt injection attacks
- **Community Resources**: Discord servers, forums, and other places where this stuff gets discussed

## Get Involved

Found a resource I missed? See something that's out of date? The repo is open for contributions.
